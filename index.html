    <p>I am a <strong>2nd year computer science student</strong> with a passion for programming and a strong desire to
        become a full-stack developer. My studies have given me a solid foundation in computer science concepts, and I
        am always eager to learn more and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

        I have experience working with various programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. I am also
        familiar with front-end development frameworks such as React, and back-end development with Node.js and Express.

        Aside from my technical skills, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with strong problem-solving and
        communication skills. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to further enhance my skills and
        contribute to the development of innovative technology solutions.

        If you have any questions or would like to work with me on a project, please feel free to reach out. I look
        forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and making a positive impact in the tech industry.</p>
